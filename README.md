# SvelteKit with SuperForms Example Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the SvelteKit with SuperForms example project! The primary aim of this project is to demonstrate the use of SvelteKit with SuperForms in a single-page application (SPA). We have employed SvelteKit Actions for optimal server-side rendering (SSR) of data.

## Project Structure
The project is structured following best practices for organizing SvelteKit applications. It uses different features from SvelteKit such as layouts, endpoints, and error pages. SuperForms is utilized to manage forms throughout the application.

## Key Features
- **SvelteKit**: This project uses [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), the official Svelte framework for building web applications of any size. It offers full support for SSR as well as client-side rendering (CSR).
- **SuperForms**: SuperForms is a Svelte store that makes it easy to manage complex forms with validation and provides integration with UI libraries.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: For improved SEO and initial load performance, the project uses SvelteKit's server-side rendering feature.

## Getting Started
In order to run the project locally, you'll need to have Node.js and pnpm installed. Here are the steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository:
   \`\`\`
   git clone <repository-url>
   \`\`\`

2. Change into the directory:
   \`\`\`
   cd <repository-name>
   \`\`\`

3. Install the dependencies:
   \`\`\`
   pnpm install
   \`\`\`

4. Start the development server:
   \`\`\`
   pnpm dev
   \`\`\`

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

## Acknowledgements
This project is an example and should be used as a starting point for building applications with SvelteKit and SuperForms.# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
